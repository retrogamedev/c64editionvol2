CharPad 2.3.0 - What's New?... 
 

- Fixed: There was a problem when loading CTM V4 files that use a 1x1 tile-set and per tile colouring, such files are
  now properly converted to tile-less/per-char colouring.

- Fixed: There was a problem causing crashes when copying tiles larger than 5x5.

- Fixed: There was a problem causing crashes when importing map data that was smaller than the current map dimensions.

- Fixed: There were some issues with window positioning when the program was not maximized.

- Fixed: There were some issues causing crashes when de-tiling/re-tiling large maps to use smaller tiles (ie. Turrican/Rambo).

- Changed: Complete code translation from C++/DotNet to C#/DotNet.  
  A number of potential problems were exposed and fixed during translation and a great many improvements have 
  been made to the program's internals.

  The switch to C# may also improve compatibility with 'Mono' for non-Windows operating systems?

- Changed: Clipboard operations on tiles now always handle pixel data (char images) not tile data, cutting/copying/pasting
  between projects should be improved as a result.

- Changed: If multi-colour mode is enabled, all four pens will now be available even if the selected item is 
  high-resolution, a warning is given if attempting to draw into a high-resolution item with a multi-colour pen.
  This allows the multi-colour pen colours to be modified without first needing to select a multi-colour item.

- Changed: The default (new) project is now an un-tiled one.

- Changed: When a project's tile system gets enabled, all child forms are now displayed.

- Changed: Duplicate tiles are now automatically removed when the tile system gets enabled.

- Changed: Smoothing of the tile-set and map images is now off by default.

- Changed: Map clipboard ops/area highlighting is now only available when using the selection tool.

- Changed: Menu and toolbar (main form) are now dynamic, available items will depend on which child form is active. 

- Changed: 'Delete' for char/tile set (items are now removed not just cleared, with reference auto-correction). 

- Changed: 'Cut' for char/tile set (items are now copied/removed, with reference auto-correction). 

- Changed: 'Paste' for char/tile set (items are now inserted, with reference auto-correction). 

- Changed: Bitmap image export of character set is now 64 characters wide (maximum, no longer fixed-width).

- Changed: Bitmap image export of tile set is now 16 tiles wide (maximum, no longer fixed-width).

- Changed: 'Paste (overwrite)' can now increase the set size when necessary.

- Changed: 'Cut' for char/tile editors has been removed (it's operations (clear/copy) are still available).

- Added: Character and tile editors now display the numbers of the current items.  

- Added: 'Insert Blank' for char/tile set (with reference auto-correction). 

- Added: 'Paste Over' for char/tile set.

- Added: 'Paste After' for char/tile set (simplifies pasting chars/tiles to the very end of a set). 

- Added: 'Range Cycle' (forwards/backwards) for char/tile set.

- Added: 'Crop' for selected chars/tiles (with reference auto-correction).

- Added: 'Crop' for selected map areas.

- Added: 'Reverse Order' for selected chars/tiles.

- Added: Project data auto-correction on project load/save.

- Added: 'Reset Window Layout' menu option.

- Added: Open/Save (project) icons to the main toolbar.
 
- Added: Warnings about tile size mismatches when copying/pasting between projects.

- Added: Warnings when decompression is not possible due to excessive chars required (>65536).

- Added: Warnings on tile and map data exports about possible value clipping when a project contains more than 256 chars
  or tiles. (exported binaries store only only 8-bit data).

- Added: Warning/correction when pasting map data with references not valid for the curent project.

- Added: Import/Export/Binary - Import char set attributes. 

- Added: Import/Export/Binary - Import tile set attributes.

- Added 'Reflect Left to Right' and 'Reflect Top to Bottom' for map data.

- Conversions between tiled/un-tiled projects process improved (no conversion offered if map blank + sensible map resizing). 

- Changed: Character editor is now sizeable and zoomable.

- Added: Scroll, Flip and Reflect operations for only the selected map area (when the Selection tool is enabled).

- Added: Map selected area fill (incremental from zero).

- Added: HTML help files.

- Added: A few additions and tweaks to the examples.

- Added: A folder of examples kindly donated by Saul Cross.
