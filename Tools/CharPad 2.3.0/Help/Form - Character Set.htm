<p><b>The Character Set Form.</b> 

<br><br>
<p>The Character Set form allows you to view and organise character images and also perform multi-image 
transformations.

<br><br> 
<p><b>Resizing the character set</b>
<p>To set the quantity of images in the character set, simply type a new quantity into the numeric entry 
box on the form's toolbar and hit enter.
<p>nb. The minimum quantity is 1 and the maximum is 65536.
 
<br><br>
<p><b>Selecting images</b>
<p>To select a single image, just click it using the left mouse button, it will appear highlighted.
<p>To select a range of images, first select a primary image as the first in a desired range, then select 
a secondary image whilst holding down the SHIFT key.
<p>The selected range will appear highlighted.

<br><br>
<p><b>Transformations</b>
<p>The following transformations are available when this form is active...
<p>-Scroll (up, down, left, right).
<p>-Flip (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
<p>-Reflect (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
<p>-Negative.
<p>-Colour swapping (for multi-colour images).
      
<br><br>
<p><b>Other functions</b>
<p>-Swapping - By selecting one image using the left mouse button and then selecting a second image 
using the right mouse button, the image's positions in the set can be swapped.
<p>-Cropping - With a range of images selected, the 'Crop' menu item will remove all images not included in 
the selection.
<p>-Cycling - With a range of images selected, the 'Cycle Backwards' and 'Cycle Forwards' menu items will 
cycle (rotate) the selected image's positions in the set by one place.
<p>nb. Image cycling does not perform correction on ie. map data, so the function can be used to produce 
an animation effect.
