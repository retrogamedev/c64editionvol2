<p><b>CharPad 2.3 User Manual - Subchrist Software, 2019.</b>


<p><b>The Project Palette Form.</b> 
<br><br> 

<p>The Project Palette form allows you to adjust various project options as well as define
the project's colour scheme and select a current pen.
<br><br>     
     
<p><b>Pens:-</b>
<p>-Transparent : Background (screen) colour, choose from all 16 colours.
<br>-Char colour : The native colour value used to render a character (or tile). See notes.
<br>-Multi-colour 1 : Only available if multi-colour mode is enabled, choose from all 16 colours.
<br>-Multi-colour 2 : Only available if multi-colour mode is enabled, choose from all 16 colours.
<br><br>     
    
<p><b>Materials:-</b>
<p>Use the left mouse button to set a material value (hex, 0-f) for the selected character(s).    
<br><br>    
    
<p><b>Char multi-colour mode:-</b>
<p>-Enabled : Any character using a char colour greater than 7 (yellow) will appear in multi-colour (4 colour) format.
<br>-Disabled : Characters can only use the high-resolution (2 colour) format. 
<br><br>     
    
<p><b>Colouring method:-</b>
<p>-Global : All characters are rendered using the same colour (in colour RAM).
<br>-Per Tile : All characters for a particular tile are rendered using the colour assigned to the tile.
<br>-Per Character : Each character is rendered using it's own colour.
<br><br>     
    
<p><b>Tile system:-</b>
<p>-Enabled : The project can make use of a tile set, the map data refers to tiles.
<br>-Disabled : The project cannot use a tile set, the map data refers to characters.
<br><br>     
    
<p><b>Notes:-</b>
<p>If character multi-colour mode is enabled, the character set may use up to four colours in 
any character that uses a char colour greater than 7 (yellow) in the colour palette with the 
restriction that the character's horizontal resolution is halved and the actual char colour can
only be one of the first 8 colours.

<p>If multi-colour mode is disabled, characters can only use two colours, the transparent colour 
and the char colour which can be any of the possible 16.  
 
<p>On the Commodore 64, colour is not a property of character images, it is a property of the screen 
matrix cells in colour RAM and so a character's colour (and multi-colour status) will depend on
the value assigned to the screen position (in colour RAM) the character is displayed in.
