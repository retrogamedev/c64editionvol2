<p><b>CharPad 2.3 User Manual - Subchrist Software, 2019.</b>

<p><b>The Tile Editor Form.</b> 

<br><br>                
<p>The Tile Editor form allows you to edit the currently selected tile.
    
<br><br> 
<p><b>Painting</b>

<p>It is important to note that there are two distinct ways to paint tiles, the first way is to use the 
'Char Brush' tool to assign character images to the tile's cells, before CharPad existed, this was the 
only way that tiles could be constructed, it was slow and extremely frustrating.

<p>The second way, only made possible by CharPad, is to draw the tile as if it were a single image having
it's own set of pixels...

<p>nb. For this method to work, it is vital that the project data be 'decompressed', doing so assigns a 
separate character image to each cell of each tile and effectively turns the tile editor into an array of 
inter-connected character image editors.

<p>With one of the pen tools selected, pixels can be drawn using the mouse.
<p>The left button draws using the currently selected colour (on the Project form) and the right button 
draws using the transparent colour.
<p>With the flood-fill tool selected, areas of the tile can be flood-filled, clicking the left mouse 
button while over the drawing canvas will flood-fill using the currently selected colour and the right 
button will flood-fill using the transparent colour.

<br><br>
<p><b>Transformations</b>
<p>The following transformations are available when this form is active...
<p>-Scroll (up, down, left, right).
<p>-Flip (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
<p>-Reflect (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
<p>-Negative.
<p>-Colour swapping (for multi-colour tiles).
