<p><b>The Tile Set Form.</b>  

<br><br>
<p>The Tile Set form allows you to view and organise the project's tiles and also perform multi-tile
transformations.

<br><br> 
<p><b>Resizing the tile set (quantity)</b>
<p>To set the quantity of tiles in the tile set, simply type a new quantity into the numeric entry 
box on the form's toolbar and hit enter.
<p>nb. The minimum quantity is 1 and the maximum is 65536.
 
<br><br> 
<p><b>Resizing the tile set (dimensions)</b>
<p>To alter the dimensions of all the tiles in the set, select a new tile size from the drop-down list
on the form's toolbar, all existing tiles will have their dimensions altered and their contents converted 
to retain the existing images as much as possible.
<p>nb. The smallest tile size is 1x2 or 2x1, the largest size is 8x8 (character images).

<br><br>
<p><b>Selecting tiles</b>
<p>To select a single tile, just click it using the left mouse button, it will appear highlighted.
<p>To select a range of tiles, first select a primary tile as the first in a desired range, then select 
a secondary tile whilst holding down the SHIFT key.
<p>The selected range will appear highlighted.

<br><br>
<p><b>Transformations</b>
<p>The following transformations are available when this form is active...
<p>-Scroll (up, down, left, right).
<p>-Flip (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
<p>-Reflect (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
<p>-Negative.
<p>-Colour swapping (for multi-colour tiles).
      
<br><br>
<p><b>Other functions</b>
<p>-Swapping - By selecting one tile using the left mouse button and then selecting a second tile 
using the right mouse button, the tile's positions in the set can be swapped.
<p>-Cropping - With a range of tiles selected, the 'Crop' menu item will remove all tiles not included in 
the selection.
<p>-Cycling - With a range of tiles selected, the 'Cycle Backwards' and 'Cycle Forwards' menu items will 
cycle (rotate) the selected tile's positions in the set by one place.
<p>nb. Tile cycling does not perform correction on ie. map data, so the function can be used to produce 
an animation effect.
