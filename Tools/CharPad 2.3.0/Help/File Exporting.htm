<p><b>Exporting Data To Files.</b> 
<br><br> 

<p>CharPad can export data in a variety of ways...


<p><br><b>Binary Files</b>
<p>These are plain (raw) binary files with no specific file-formatting and will only contain the data that has been exported.
<p>Character Sets : 8 bytes per character image (byte 0 = top pixel row of image 0) for however many character images.
<p>Character Set Attributes : 1 byte per image (upper nybble = Material, lower nybble = Colour). 
<p>Tile Sets : TileWidth x TileHeight bytes per tile (byte 0 = top/left corner of tile 0) for however many tiles.
<p>Tile Set Attributes : 1 byte per tile (upper nybble = unused (0), lower nybble = Colour).
<p>Map : MapWidth x MapHeight bytes (byte 0 = top/left corner). 


<p><br><b>Text Files</b>
<p>CharPad can output a human-readble ASCII text file containing all the data for a project, it will be given the extension 'asm'
as it can also be assembled (into machine code) by feeding it to a suitable 65XX CPU assembler program such as 64TASS.


<p><br><b>Image files</b>
<p>These can be either Microsoft Windows Bitmap (bmp) or Portable Network Graphics (png) format. 
 

<p><br><b>Shoot 'em Up Construction Kit (background) files</b>
<p>Commonly referred to as SEUCK, the Shoot 'em Up Construction Kit was (and remains) a popular tool for making games on the 
Commodore 64.
<p>CharPad can output a background file in a format that is compatible with the Shoot 'em Up Construction Kit, it will contain 
a character set, a tile set and a map.
<p>nb. To be eligible for export as a SEUCK background, a CharPad project MUST have these properties...
<p>254 character images.
<p>128 (5x5) tiles.
<p>1 map (8 x 512).
<p>Colouring Method : Per Tile.
