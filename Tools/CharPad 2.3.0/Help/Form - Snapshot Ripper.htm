<p><b>The Snapshot Ripper Form</b>
<br><br>

<p>The Snapshot Ripper form allows you to search for useable project data inside a Commodore 64 emulator 
snapshot file.

<p>The tool currently only supports snapshots made with the VICE (x64) emulator.

<p>nb. Data ripping can be a somewhat expert skill and novices attempting it may struggle to find much more than a 
character set.  


<br><br> 
<p><b>The File menu...</b> 
<p> - Open Snapshot : Brings up a file dialog where you can choose a snapshot (.vsf) file to load. 
<p> - Save RAM Dump : Brings up a file dialog where you can choose where to save a (raw binary) 64K RAM dump. 
<p> - Exit : Closes the tool.


<p><b>The Options menu...</b>
<p> - Reset Configuration : Sets all controls to their default positions.  
<p> - Recall Previous Configuration : Sets all controls to the positions recorded by a previous use.


<br><br>
<p><b>Address Specifiers...</b>

<br><br>
<p> - Character Set : Use the scroll-bar to search for a character set.
<p>nb. a character set used by the C64 must sit on a 2KB boundary, hence there are only 32 possible locations in 64KB. 

<br><br>
<p> - Character Attributes : Use the scroll-bar (and offset control) to search for character attribute data.
<p>nb. character attribute data may exist literally anywhere in the 64K and may not even be in a format useable by CharPad. 
<p>nb. Character attribute searching is only available to projects using the per-char colouring method. 

<br><br>
<p> - Tile Set : Use the scroll-bar (and offset control) to search for a tile set.
<p>nb. tile set data may exist literally anywhere in the 64K and may not even be in a format useable by CharPad.

<br><br>
<p> - Map : Use the scroll-bar (and offset control) to search for map data.
<p>nb. map data may exist literally anywhere in the 64K and may not even be in a format useable by CharPad.


<br><br>
<p><b>Map Dimension Controls...</b>
<p> - Map Width : You can type a specific map width or scroll through all possibilities. 
<p> - Map Height : You can type a specific map height or scroll through all possibilities. 


<br><br>
<p><b>Tile Data Format</b> - Choose from 8 (Z-Pattern) formats, left-right, top-bottom (LRTB) is the most common.
<p><b>Map Data Format</b> - Choose from 8 (Z-Pattern) formats, left-right, top-bottom (LRTB) is the most common.
<p><b>Map Data Cipher : XOR</b> - Choose a (byte) value with which to defeat an XOR (exclusive OR) cipher used on the map data.
<p><b>Map Data Cipher : ROR</b> - Choose a quantity with which to defeat a binary rotation cipher used on the map data (0-7).


<br><br>
<p><b>Notes:-</b>
<p>When the snapshot ripper is closed...
<p> - The 64K memory is not cleared so you may return to it without having to reload the same snapshot file.
<p> - The last configuration of the controls is automatically saved for recall using the menu option.
