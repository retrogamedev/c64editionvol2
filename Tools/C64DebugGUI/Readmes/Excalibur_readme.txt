Excalibur 2.00

INSTALLATION:

There is no longer an automated install for Excalibur 2.00. You simply extract it to any directory and run it from there. 
Excalibur is not designed to install any components or modify the registry. It will write a small Excal32.dat file to
save settings, etc. You can remove older versions of Excalibur (1.06, 1.05, etc) using the stanard Windows Add/Remove
Programs (since those older versions used a standard Installer).
